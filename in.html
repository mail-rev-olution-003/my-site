            <p>It has been a true joy to spend these months with you at Alliance Française. Though you won’t be with us in the next session, I wanted to give you these bracelets, a small reminder that you have a brother who will always stand by you and cheer for your success. A friend may have an end, but family holds its final three letters close, whispering,“I love you.” You’re not just a friend, you are a sister. Be sure to let your brothers know they’ve gained a third one now, haha. Like the buttercup, a flower symbolizing happiness and warmth, you embody a radiant spirit that brings light wherever you go. I see such incredible potential in you, a gift to change the world for the better. Your problem-solving skills in our discussions, your creativity in our debates, and the passion with which you view the world and explain scriptures—it’s all proof of the greatness you carry within. But remember to explore deeper. Your true self is far more powerful than the version you see now. Unlock that power, without letting fear or shyness hold you back. You already shine with boldness and light; let the world see that brilliance in full! I pray that God leads you to your true purpose and that you embrace it fearlessly. A small word of advice: be cautious with how you relate to others, especially the boys at Alliance Française. Be kind and friendly, but keep your boundaries firm. Saying "no" is a strength. Don’t feel guilt for protecting yourself and your heart—it’s an act of love for both you and them. Know that I’m always here for you. Whether you need to talk, brainstorm, or seek solutions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Be comfortable with me, always. Be your true, vibrant self. And don’t forget—we still have that car race to win, someday! Wishing you nothing but the best. May God bless you abundantly in all that you pursue. Welcome to the family</p>
